TODO

It would be great to have an installation script that would:

1 - check to make sure that a virtual env is active, and confirm with the user that it is the correct one

2 - read in one or more script templates, and prompt the user for the values 

3 - write out the scripts into the $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/ directory, replacing tokens with the user-entered values


Validation of the user-entered values might be nice, but can be done later.
