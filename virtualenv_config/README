The files in this directory can be used to customize the virtualenv for this project so that the appropriate environment variables are automatically set/unset upon activating/deactivating the virtualenv. 

The convention is to create a separate virtualenv for each project, and to give it the same name as the project.

To install these customizations:

1. Make sure that you've created a virtualenv for this project, and make sure it is active

2. Copy the postactivate and postdeactivate scripts from this directory into your virtualenv bin directory:

    cp post* $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/

3. Edit those two scripts in $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/ to add the appropriate environment variable values.  MAKE SURE THAT THE SECRET VALUES DO NOT END UP IN THE SOURCE CODE REPOSITORY!
