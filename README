Run the gunicorn server with :

python manage.py run_gunicorn -w 10 -p gunicorn.pid -D -b 127.0.0.1:8001

This application requires the following environment variables to be set:

DJANGO_DB_PASSWORD
DJANGO_DB_USER

When running the application, you'll also need to point to the correct settings. 

E.g. for local development, you could do:

python manage.py --settings=icommons_tools.settings.local runserver 10.0.2.15:3000

or in production, use --settings=icommons_tools.settings.production instead

Another option is to set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable to the correct class.

export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=icommons_tools.settings.qa
